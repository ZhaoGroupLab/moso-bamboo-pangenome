#1.Generate an initial gene set file (GS_0.txt) based on the list of BLAST results (blastp results between any two genomic protein sequences)
perl allele_cluster.pl blasts.list GS_0.txt
#2.Add unclustered genes to the gene set file
perl get_all_allelepair.pl GS_0.txt all.gene.name.list GS_1.txt
#3.Extract the final gene set results (geneset.txt) using the similarity and positional relationships of all genes(all.blast)
perl mcscan_cluster_split.pl all.blast GS_1.txt geneset.txt
